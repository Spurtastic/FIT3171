# Assignment 1

Ok cool, 

So if you are in the group I will add you on whatsapp and we will  work more then. 

## Links to WBA and to UML doc(We will attach the WBA.md file once we have a concrete setup for the WBA)

* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPn5lcQZJZDkJ9ml0CoiVL3hEvQRuBFjVLXSVCnJzoo/edit    -WBA
* https://app.diagrams.net/#G1z171axW7UG9OCfnDcFWxs5pltmFQ9suG                            -UML



## Important commands to remember(please add more commands as you discover it, so that we can gel the collab)

* Basic order of commands
    * git log --oneline(to check the commits that have happened)
    * git checkout yourbranch
        * once in your branch do the below
            * git add -A
            * git commit -m "please put a good message to keep track"
            * git push --set-upstream origin yourBranch

        * once you feel like your work is done and you want to merge with the master do the following 
            * git checkout master
            * git merge username_branch


* if you mess up and want to undo(hence why you need a good commit message)
    * git log --oneline
    * git reset the ADDRESS
    * NOTE: its better to create another branch experiment, mess around and then come back to your original branch later on 
 
example,
```console 
$git log --oneline
f5afa6b (HEAD -> master) Instructions on how to git, and also a place to throw ideas around
0714153 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) Initial commit
ab99ef5 Mistake
$git reset -0714153
```
